# METS team ownership

Each team member owns a specialist module. The module READMEs describe responsibilities, implementation and testing. Shared contract changes require coordination across the affected modules.

## Shared contracts (ask before changing)

- `src/agents/_shared/types.ts`
- `src/agents/index.ts`
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

A specialist agent must not import another specialist. Only orchestration / the chat route may choose which student-facing agent to run. Guardrail is hooked from the chat route after the reply; it is never a routing target.

## Prompt versioning

Each agent exports `*_PROMPT_VERSION`. Bump it when you edit `prompts.ts` so Langflow logs stay comparable. Copy the gist into `langflow/prompts/`.

## Persistence

Student profiles, conversations, chat memory, chat-chunk pgvector, evals, and Guardrail alerts persist in the same Supabase project when `SUPABASE_URL` is set with a service role / secret key, or with the anon/publishable key plus the user's JWT. Syllabus RAG still reads markdown in `data/syllabus/`.
