# Math Agent

**Owner:** Gu Haixiang  
**Folder:** `src/agents/math/`  
**Syllabus corpus:** `data/syllabus/math.md`

**Results:** [runs/](./runs/) holds a record of every eval run, from the 29 September baseline onwards.  
**History:** [archive/](./archive/) keeps the September design plan, build plan and review.

Tell a coding agent: *You are working on the METS Math Agent only. Read this file fully. Do not edit other specialist folders. Do not build quizzes here.*

## Job

Teach Singapore mathematics at the student's band:

- Primary (including P6 model drawing / heuristics)
- Secondary O-Level Mathematics and Additional Mathematics
- JC H1/H2 Mathematics

You explain, show working, and verify numbers. If the student wants a quiz, tell them to ask for a test so Orchestration can send them to Testing. You may still help if they paste a question.

## Files you may change

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `prompts.ts` | System prompt. Bump `MATH_PROMPT_VERSION` on every edit. |
| `index.ts` | `createMathAgent` wiring: tools, guardrails, output cap. |
| `step-budget.ts` | Reserves the last of the 8 steps for a written reply (tools off). Bounds model calls, not wall-clock time. |
| `first-step.ts` | Which tool the first step must use when the question makes it obvious. A live examination forces no tool. |
| `step-budget.ts` | Last step and any step after 40 s must write the answer, so a turn ends inside the 60-second hosting limit. |
| `model.ts` | This agent's model (`MATH_MODEL`) and an optional dated snapshot (`MATH_MODEL_SNAPSHOT`). |
| `tools.ts` | `equationSolver` and `drawMathGraph` (mathjs). |
| `exam-facts.ts` | `examFacts`: checked SEAB exam-format facts, each with its source and check date. |
| `guardrails.ts` | Output repair: abuse, prompt disclosure, self-drawn images, LaTeX delimiters, cut-off replies. |
| `graph-types.ts`, `math-graph-widget.tsx` | Client rendering of `drawMathGraph` output (JSXGraph). |
| `runs/` | Eval run records and the gold-answer review. |
| `src/evals/catalog/math.ts` | Math eval cases. |
| `langflow/prompts/math.system.md` | Summary of `prompts.ts`; its version must match (tested). |

## Tools you must keep

- `equationSolver` checks arithmetic and algebra before a final answer. It solves linear, quadratic and cubic equations in one unknown and differentiates. It cannot integrate symbolically, keep surds exact, or solve simultaneous or trigonometric equations: do those by hand and say so. An integral is checked by differentiating the answer.
- `drawMathGraph` draws y = f(x). The widget gets the plotted points; the model gets only a summary, so it cannot copy the data into its reply.
- `examFacts` is the source for papers, timing, marks, calculator rules, weightings, supplied formulae and marking of working. Re-check the facts against SEAB when a new exam year is published, and update `EXAM_FACTS_CHECKED_ON`.
- `documentSearch` is shared, with subject `"math"`, and decides whether a topic is in a syllabus.
- `webSearch` is optional. Syllabus search and exam facts come first.

Add new tools in their own file or `tools.ts`, register them in `index.ts`, and add a first-step rule only when the trigger is unambiguous and tested with phrasings outside the eval set.

## Files you must not change

- Other agents under `src/agents/physics`, `chemistry`, `testing`, `orchestration`
- Quiz widgets (`src/components/quiz-widget.tsx`) unless Sritam asks; those belong to Testing + UI
- Database / Supabase code (not in this slice)

## Pinning the model

Set `MATH_MODEL` to the model id for this agent. Unset, it uses `OPENAI_MODEL`, then `gpt-4o`. `gpt-4o` is an alias the provider can move. To pin a dated snapshot, set `MATH_MODEL_SNAPSHOT` to a dated version of the selected alias, for example `MATH_MODEL=gpt-4o` and `MATH_MODEL_SNAPSHOT=gpt-4o-2024-08-06`, in `.env.local` and in the Vercel project settings. The pin applies only when the selected model is that alias, so evaluation runs on other models are unaffected. Unset or malformed snapshot values leave the selected model unchanged. Re-run the Math suite after setting or changing it, and record the snapshot in the run note.

## Prompt rules

- Singapore English spelling.
- LaTeX for mathematics (`$...$` / `$$...$$`).
- Name the method (chain rule, sine rule, completing the square) before using it.
- Stay inside the band. Do not introduce university content unless the student asks.
- Quote syllabus coverage only from `documentSearch`, and exam rules only from `examFacts`.

## How to test

Ask the desk:

- "Differentiate x^2 sin x for H2."
- "What is 3/4 of 12? Show working."
- "Is Maclaurin series in O-Level?" (should check syllabus and say no)

- "Can I use a calculator in A-Math Paper 1?" (should use exam facts and say yes)
- "Sketch y = x^2 - 4x + 3" (graph with roots and turning point)

Confirm the message stamp says **Math** and that the expected tool appears as a tool line. Then run the Math suite on `/evals/scores` and compare with the latest record in `runs/`.
